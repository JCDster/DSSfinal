As time increases, factor increases, until factor resets to 1. This factor is used to estimate the value of pi. The larger the factor, the closer the number is to true pi. In the graphs above you can see this relationship. In an hour The factors loop from 1 to 205379 and the factors are the minute from the start of a cycle cubed, so minute 1 is 1, 2 is 8, 3 is 27 and so on. This is then used as a factor to calculate pi, and it gets closer and closer to the true value.
